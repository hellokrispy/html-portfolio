<h1>About Me</h1>

I am also interested in creating apps for fellow physicians that work in healthcare centers that are not able to afford more sophisticated eMR</p>

<p>Briefly, I was born in the Philippines and spent my formative years moving around the United States, mainly California and New York.  I studied at SUNY at Buffalo and graduated with a double major in Biology and Social Sciences with a concentration in Early Childhood Development.  Post-grad, I worked for a couple of years in educational and residential settings as a teacher's assistant and mental health specialist.
  Those years of working in the social services field nurtured my interest in pursuing a medical degree.  I decided to return to the Philippines and completed my medical degree at University of Santo Tomas. Afterwards, I went back to US to finish a 3-year pediatric residency at Univeristy of Hawaii.  Currently, I am working at an underserved area in Honolulu, HI and planning on returning to the Philippines for a few months of medical service.
